            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Founded in 2008, GitHub is an open source and free version control system for use with projects that need file management. "It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git as well as adding its own features" (Github). Funny enough, Microsoft is actually in works to buy GitHub, which is a recent development. The company is valued at about $2 billion!</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git itself is a centralized revision control system, "the Git feature that really makes it stand apart from nearly every other SCM out there is its branching model. Git allows and encourages you to have multiple local branches that can be entirely independent of each other" (git-scm.com). Whereas GitHub is a decentralized hosting service for repositories made via Git. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control are systems designed to record and organize the files and the changes in files over time. This method allows you to keep each version of a file along its timeline, easily allows you to revert back to previous versions of the save file, and lastly, lets you compare these changes over time. This is made possible by timestamps creating these "revisions". For large projects having version control is essential because it tells you exactly who changed or updated a file and when. And on top of it all, version control systems back up all of your files, but don't overwrite them.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A repository in version control is essential the organized metadata for a certain set of files or a data structure. This metadata contains the timestamps and commit objects. There are two types of repositories, remote and local. GitHub would be an example of a remote repository that uses a distributed version control system in which the files reside on a server accessible by all members of a team.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GIT commands are lines of code that are used for a variety of purposes, but they can be broken down into four main components, initializing, staging, committing, and maintaining. These commands are used to properly ensure that your repositories are set up correctly and associated with the correct profiles. An example of some of these commands are git init, git add - all, git log, and git status.</p>
